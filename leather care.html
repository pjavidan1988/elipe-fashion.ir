                            Maintain your favorite leather pieces regularly
                            to ensure soft and supple leather. Leather can be
                            cleaned and restored with a regimen of leather care
                            products designed to clean, condition and protect.

                            Leather Care can help maintain your product longer.
                            We recommend conditioning your leather at a minimum of
                            every 6 months. If you are in a dryer (hot or cold) climate
                            please condition your product as soon as it feels less supple,
                            dull or faded. Vegetable tanned leather when conditioned should
                            feel slightly oiled and look rich. Similar to the nature of skin
                            it needs to be moisturized as soon as it feels dry.
